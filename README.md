Expedition
==========

A sci-fi roguelike, with horror elements. More puzzle and skill focused rather than combat focused.

Written using the libtcod library. The library included is 1.5.1 linux 32bit version. When the game is complete, I will release versions with the appropriate libraries for different systems

Story

(written by Matt Calfe)

10 minutes ago: Life support is still functioning, that's good... Intership teleport systems, also functioning... Environmental controls, down. Damn. What about propulsion? Dammit that's gone as well. What the hell happened? One minute I'm in stasis, next I'm having to do a full system diagnosis. The other pods were open, I'll try and raise the crew on the ship's hailer... And the Coms don't work. Fucking excellent. 

5 minutes ago: I found out where the crew is... dead. All just dead in one room of the ship, laser marks all over the fucking walls and no sign of the assailant. I don't know what the fuck is going on, or what the fuck I'm supposed to do about it, but there are a lot of ships on the external scanners. I'll beam aboard them, see if I can get some help.

Now:  The entire fleet is dead - no-one responds to hails, and scans of the ships reveal no Human life signatures. No human life signs, but plenty of OTHER signs. This is not good. Looks like I'll need to find a functional ship and get the fuck out of here. #CLANG# â€¦ what the fuck was that noise? Ok, ok, don't panic. Beam from ship to ship, find one that works, fly home. That's the game plan...
